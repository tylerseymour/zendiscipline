# PyCharm Setup

Navigate to Pycharm->Preferences in the menu, and make sure these settings are in place:

1) [Django Settings](img/pycharm-django-settings.png)
2) [Template Settings](img/pycharm-template-settings.png)
3) Right (or control)-click on the `templates` folder (for each project, such as `wiki`), select `Mark directory as`, and select `Template Folder` [Screenshot](img/pycharm-template-settings.png)
4) Repeat the same thing, but for the `static` folder, marking it as `Resource Root`
